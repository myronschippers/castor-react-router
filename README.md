# React Router, S.P.A. (Single Page Application)

We are incorporating a new dependency to allow our Client-Side React application to take on the responsibilities of page navigation with `react-router-dom`.

> NOTE: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
